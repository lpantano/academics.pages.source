# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules (~22 nucleotide long) involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies led to the discovery of isomiRs, which are miRNA sequence variants. In the last year, a few papers have pointed the lack of accuracy of miRNA abundance detection by sequencing technologies. Here, we extend the research to the accuracy of isomiRs detection and quantification by the same technologies. This is an ongoing project of the miRTOP group: https://github.com/miRTop/incubator/tree/master/projects"
